Hi.

In this repository you can find my solution for a technical assignment from Posti company.
It was written using Robotframework 5.0.1 and SeleniumLibrary in PyCharm 2022.1.4 IDE.

Technical assignment:

Navigate to https://www.posti.fi/en/private/parcels-and-tracking
1) User can track the parcels without logging in to the application and see all the events applicable to the shipment
(test data: CF753732593DE).

2) Application must display a notice if shipments are not found “No items could be found based on the tracking code” and
display other possible reasons why the shipment is not traceable.

3) User can also send letters and mails using https://www.posti.fi/en/private/letters-and-mail and choosing products like
letter or postcard https://www.posti.fi/en/private/letters-and-mail/send-a-letter-or-postcard without login.

4) User should have the possibility to calculate the price of a letter by using
https://www.posti.fi/en/private/letters-and-mail/send-a-letter-or-postcard/letter-price-calculator
